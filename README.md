Launching the Streamlit Application
The dataset (ibibio.csv) and the three python scripts (classify.py, ibom.py and ibibio_app.py) must be in the same folder (you can create an empty folder for this). Then follow the following steps;
Go to the Start Menu on your computer and launch the Command Prompt (or GitBash, Anaconda Prompt etc.)
Navigate to the file location
Type the command streamlit run ibibio_app.py and press enter

This will show, and the interface will load on your browser page, ready for use!
